# xfaith4 — Ben Fuhr

**Senior Cloud Engineer specializing in observability automation** — turning **APIs, logs, and telemetry** into **decision-grade insight** (mostly with **PowerShell**).

I build tools that make complex systems *legible*: you should be able to look at a dashboard, a report, or a single exported file and know **what happened**, **why it matters**, and **what to do next**.

## What you’ll find here

This profile is a **cabinet of working instruments**:
- **Operational visibility** (signals from noise, anomaly → story → action)
- **Automation that sticks** (repeatable workflows, sane defaults, clean outputs)
- **Tooling that respects humans** (clear UX, accessible reports, “what now?” guidance)

I’m also unapologetically curious. Some repos are polished. Some are explorations. The point is forward motion—and occasionally finding something that wasn’t supposed to be there.

## Featured projects

| Project | What it is | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| **SystemDashboard** | Home-network + device telemetry + system events → a practical observability UI | Puts you in the **well-informed driver’s seat** of your LAN/Wi-Fi world |
| **Genesys-API-Explorer-2** | A top-shelf Genesys Cloud tool that makes backend APIs *business-useful* | Shortens time-to-answer for ops/investigation and reduces “API archaeology” |
| **Family_GenealogyTool_Lite** | A smooth way for people of all ages to explore lineage and historical context | Makes family history **navigable, engaging, and durable** |
| **PhotoToolboxv2** | Offline photo organization + metadata workflows (including face-ish tooling direction) | Breaks “cloud-only” assumptions; keeps capability **local and controlled** |
| **UnifiedAIToolbox** | AI tools made visible and understandable—learning by instrumentation and experimentation | Demystifies AI so more people can use it with **intention** (not vibes) |

> I prefer tools that produce **shareable artifacts**: HTML reports, exports, screenshots, and “here’s the evidence” summaries.

## My working philosophy (the “mentalist” part)

Most systems are honest—they just speak in fragmented languages.

My approach is simple and relentless:

1. **Observe** — instrument the system until it can’t hide
2. **Infer** — compress complexity into a small set of meaningful signals
3. **Intervene** — automate the next best action (or at least make it obvious)

The goal isn’t to “collect data.”  
The goal is to produce *clarity* that survives reality.

## Tooling I reach for

- **PowerShell** (modules, automation pipelines, reporting)
- **APIs + telemetry** (the system tells on itself if you listen correctly)
- **Dashboards + exports** (HTML, CSV/Excel, structured logs)
- **Pragmatic data stores** (SQLite/Postgres when it’s time to stop pretending JSON is enough)

---

## Current curiosity streams

- “Single pane of glass” dashboards that are actually dense *and* readable  
- From raw event logs → narrative timelines (“police investigation mode”)  
- Offline-first workflows that still feel modern (photos, metadata, indexing)  
- Operational metrics that connect to decisions (capacity, quality, experience)

### A personal note

> **If a goal doesn’t collapse complexity somewhere in your life, it’s suspect.**
